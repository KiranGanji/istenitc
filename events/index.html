								<h2>AKS</h2>
								<p>Abdul Kalam Scholarship(AKS) The Abdul Kalam Scholarship(AKS) is the premier scholarship examination conducted by ISTE exclusively for the first years. Format: The AKS is divided into three stages based on which the judgement is made- Written test, Group Discussion (GD) and a Personal Interview. SAT & SET: The first written stage is the screening stage where all the candidates have to write two examinations, the SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) and the SET (Special Entrance Test),both of which every candidate must attempt in one sitting. The SAT is designed to test the Student's Aptitude through a set of brain-racking questions. The SET basically consists of questions from the four basic fields of science: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Computer Science. It is a completely objective, multiple-choice question paper which is designed to check upon the candidate's flair in the four branches of science. The papers will be evaluated and the top 10% of students (with weightage being given to both the papers)will be selected. GD: The Qualifying Scholars from the Written test will be asked to discuss on topics given by the panel of judges.The student's knowledge of concepts and his/her communication skills is evaluated in this round. Further shortlisting ensues and successful candidates move on to the next round. PI: Now, these AK Scholars will have to undergo the PI (Personal Interview) round. In this round, the Scholars are suppose to face grilling by our interview panel which is further sub-divided into two parts, one comprising of 2nd and 3rd years and the other comprising of 4th years. The questions shot at the Scholars will be general questions based upon the CVs and also there will be questions from which we will judge the candidate's perspective of looking at certain situations. Eventually, after all these rounds, we will select candidates for the top three positions and those scholars holding the first, second and third positions will be awarded with cash prize of Rs. 3500, Rs. 2500 and Rs. 1500 respectively.
